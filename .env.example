# Image Processing Configuration
# These settings can be adjusted based on your requirements and infrastructure capacity

# File size limits (in bytes)
# MAX_FILE_SIZE: Maximum allowed file size for image uploads
# MIN_FILE_SIZE: Minimum required file size to prevent empty/corrupted files
MAX_FILE_SIZE=52428800  # 50MB (default) - Adjust based on your storage and bandwidth capacity
MIN_FILE_SIZE=100       # 100 bytes (default) - Minimum viable image file size

# Thumbnail generation settings
# THUMBNAIL_MAX_SIZE: Maximum dimension (width/height) for generated thumbnails
# THUMBNAIL_QUALITY: JPEG compression quality (1-100, higher = better quality but larger files)
THUMBNAIL_MAX_SIZE=300  # 300px (default) - Balance between quality and loading speed
THUMBNAIL_QUALITY=85    # JPEG quality 1-100 (default: 85) - Good balance of quality/size

# Environment-specific configurations:

# Development environment (more permissive for testing)
# MAX_FILE_SIZE=104857600  # 100MB - Allow larger files for testing
# MIN_FILE_SIZE=1024       # 1KB - Slightly higher minimum
# THUMBNAIL_MAX_SIZE=400   # 400px - Higher resolution thumbnails
# THUMBNAIL_QUALITY=90     # Higher quality for better preview

# Production environment (optimized for performance and cost)
# MAX_FILE_SIZE=26214400   # 25MB - Reduce to save bandwidth and storage
# MIN_FILE_SIZE=1024       # 1KB - Prevent tiny corrupted files
# THUMBNAIL_MAX_SIZE=300   # 300px - Standard web thumbnail size
# THUMBNAIL_QUALITY=80     # Lower quality for faster loading and storage efficiency

# High-volume production (strict limits)
# MAX_FILE_SIZE=10485760   # 10MB - Very restrictive for high-volume usage
# MIN_FILE_SIZE=2048       # 2KB - Higher minimum to ensure quality
# THUMBNAIL_MAX_SIZE=250   # 250px - Smaller thumbnails for faster loading
# THUMBNAIL_QUALITY=75     # Lower quality for maximum storage efficiency
